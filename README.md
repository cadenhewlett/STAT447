## Project Description

This is an overview of the project. Full details are in `main.pdf`.
### Introduction

This project presents a non-parametric approach to the Gamma-Poisson (GP) model framework using weekly aggregation of daily crash count data from the Chicago Police Department. The main goal is to integrate the GP Bayesian Model with the `dirichletprocess` R package, which does not have an out-of-the-box solution for this setup.

### Methods

The project utilizes the stick-breaking process to define the Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (DPMM) and implements a custom mixing distribution for the Gamma-Poisson conjugate pair.

### Results

The results include posterior parameter estimates, cluster assignments, and predictive densities. The analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the DPMM in identifying varying rates of crash counts.
