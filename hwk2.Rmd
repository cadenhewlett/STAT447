## Question 1 : Define a Bayesian Model

In order to perform inference on the unknown quantities, we must specify how they relate to the data; i.e., we need a probabilistic model. Assume that every Delta 7925H rocket has the same probability 
$p$ of failing. For simplicity, let us assume that $p$ is allowed to take values on an evenly space grid

$$p \in \left\{\frac{k}{K}: k\in \{0,\dots,K\}\right\}$$

for some fixed $k \in \mathbb{N}$. Furthermore, we have access to a collection of numbers 
$\rho_k$ such that:

$$
\forall k\in\{0,\dots,K\}:\ \mathbb{P}\left(p=\frac{k}{K}\right) = \rho_k
$$

Let $Y_i$ denote a binary variable with $Y_i = 1$ encoding a success, and $Y_i = 0$ a failure. 
We assume that, conditionally on $p$, the $Y_i$â€™s are independent of each other.

We will use the following prior:
$$\rho_k \propto \frac{k}{K}\left(1-\frac{k}{K}\right)$$

From now on, use $K = 20$

## Part 1

What are the unknown quantities in this scenario? And what is the data?


**Solution**: In this case, we can think of two unknown quantities and one piece of known data. One unknown metric is $Y_i$, whether or not the rocket is going to fail. The other unknown quantity is the success probability of the rockets - this was denoted $p$.  This is much like the "coin flip" scenario from the previous homework, where $Y_i$ was "whether or not we flip a heads," and the distribution of coin biases (i.e. the probability we pick a coin with bias $k/K$) was $\rho_k$. 

In this case, the data is given in the setup section, and is simply that as of Jan 2024, Delta 7925H rockets have been launched 3 times, with 0 failed launches. Further, we have $\rho_k$, the probability that the *true* probability $p$ is $k/K$ for a given discrete $k$.
