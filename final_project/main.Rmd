## Introduction and Review:


Before we discuss Dirichlet Processes, some fundamental groundwork in probability measure theory will be established. We will briefly recap the concepts of $\sigma$-algebra, probability measures and Dirichlet Distributions. We will take slightly more relaxed definitions than can be found in formal measure theory works such as [@billingsley2012probability]. 


Let $\mathbb{X}$ be a well-defined sample space. A $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{F} \subseteq P(\mathbb{X})$ is a set satisfying the following:

\vspace{-5mm}
  1. The entire sample space $\mathbb{X}$ is in $\mathcal{F}$. 
  2. For all sets $A \in \mathcal{F}$, the complement $A^c \in \mathcal{F}$. This property is referred to as "closure under complementation."
  3. For any countable index set $I$ and collection of sets $\{A_i\}_{i \in I}$ such that $\forall i \in I, A_i \in \mathcal{F} \implies \bigcup_{i \in I}A_i \in \mathcal{F}.$ This is referred to as "closure under countable unions."
More detail on properties 1-3 can be found in analysis works such as [@rudin1986real]. For the sake of this work,

For the sake of this work, we are more interested in *probability measures*, which are built on $\sigma$-algebra. A probability $\mu$ measure $\upmu : \mathcal{F} \mapsto [0,1]$ is a pro
