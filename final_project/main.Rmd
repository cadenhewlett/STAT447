**Introduction and Review**:


Before we discuss Dirichlet Processes, some fundamental groundwork in probability measure theory will be established. We will briefly recap the concepts of $\sigma$-algebra, probability measures and Dirichlet Distributions. We will take slightly more relaxed definitions than can be found in formal measure theory works such as [@billingsley2012probability]. 


A $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{F}$ is a set satisfying the following three key properties:

  1. The entire sample space $\mathcal{X}$ is in $\mathcal{F}$
  2. For all sets $A \in \mathcal{F}$, the complement $A^c \in \mathcal{F}$. This property is referred to as
